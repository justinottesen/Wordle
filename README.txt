Wordle by Justin Ottesen

Copy of the well known popular game.

NOTE: I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN RUN ON WINDOWS, USES SOME FUNKY TEXT
HIGHLIGHTING THINGS FOR LINUX.

Quickly put this together, similarly to 2048, planning on adding a bot to
play the game, but at this stage it is playable. Setting the answer is
somewhat clunky, but wanted to make it work for an answer list of any size.
Probably should store all possible answers in the game class, which would add
easy replayability, just stick main in a loop.

Didnt like the UI so I made it better, now has keyboard show up with text
coloring and eliminates used letters. I also fixed bug in old version where
the game would continue until 6 guesses regardless of whether correct guess
was made before then.

FUTURE PLANS:
- Save history in file
- Display statistics similarly to real Wordle
- Bot to play game
